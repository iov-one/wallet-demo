# Design Process

The general workflow is from designer -> developer, and then back for refinements and review.

## Tooling

We use a zeplin.io account to hand off designs between the designers and the developers.
If you cannot see any of the links, please request access to the account.

## Styleguide

There is a general styleguide to define all the common UI elements, which will expand as we
develop the UI further. Please refer to this for clarification on any elements.

## New feature development

For features that are specified in the backlog in the upcoming sprints, we need to have
a design before accepting them into the sprint. This process should look like:

* Designer implements a proposal for the ui/ux for the feature (after talking to other stakeholders if needed)
* Design proposal is presented to developers at least one week before sprint start (planned biweekly design review meeting)
* Designer has time to integrate any feedback (eg. what do we show when there are no transactions? when the network connection breaks?)
* Developers should accept story into sprint with an acceptable design done ahead of time

## Design implementation review

* Issue (#xxx) exists with specification and an attached link for the design (from above process)
* Developer makes a PR implementing those changes (linking it with "Closes #xxx")
* Developer may raise questions about details while coding, which should be updated quickly
* When implemented, request PR review from the designer
* Designer may approves it, or adds comments for needed fixes. Comments can be provided with a link to the zeplin design if easier.
* Developer addresses changes if needed and requests review again
* Once approved, PR and issue are closed üëç
